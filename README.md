## **Security Log Analysis and Reporting Automation**

### **Overview**
This project automated the analysis of security logs and the generation of detailed reports to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of incident detection and response. The system utilizes Python, Bash scripting, and regular expressions to parse logs and Cron for scheduling tasks.

### **Features**
- **Automated Log Parsing**:
  - Developed Python scripts to parse large log files and extract relevant security events using regular expressions.
- **Scheduled Analysis**:
  - Configured Cron jobs to perform periodic log analysis and generate reports.
- **Incident Reporting**:
  - Automated generation of detailed security incident reports, highlighting anomalies and potential threats.

### **Tools & Technologies**
- **Python**: Used for log analysis and report generation.
- **Bash**: Scripting for integrating and orchestrating the automation process.
- **Cron**: Scheduled tasks for consistent and timely log processing.
- **Regular Expressions**: Extracted meaningful patterns from unstructured log data.

### **Installation & Setup**
#### **1. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/security-log-automation.git
cd security-log-automation
```

#### **2. Configure the Environment**
- Install required Python libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- Modify `log_config.json` to specify paths to log files and reporting directories.

#### **3. Schedule the Script**
- Add the Python script to a Cron job for automated execution:
  ```bash
  crontab -e
  ```
  Example entry for hourly analysis:
  ```bash
  0 * * * * /usr/bin/python3 /path/to/log_analysis.py
  ```

### **Usage**
- Run the script manually for initial testing:
  ```bash
  python3 log_analysis.py
  ```
- Check the `reports/` directory for generated incident reports.
- Use reports to inform incident response actions and improve monitoring practices.
